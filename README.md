> "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s

Steve Jobs (Apple Founder)

> "I learned that focus is key. Not just in your running a company, but in your personal

> "You can achieve so much when you truly focus. What focus means is saying no to something that

Sir Jony Ive (Chief Design Officer, Apple)
