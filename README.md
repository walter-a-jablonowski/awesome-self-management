## Reduce complexity

In my opinion this might be the most valuable one, because this is where the huge success of more than one silion valley founder came from.

> "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s
> no what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are."

Steve Jobs (Apple Founder)

> "I learned that focus is key. Not just in your running a company, but in your personal
> life as well."

Tim Cook (CEO, Apple)

> "You can achieve so much when you truly focus. What focus means is saying no to something that
> with every bone in your body think is a phenomenal idea, and you wake up thinking about it, but
> you end up saying no to it because you’re focusing on something else."

Sir Jony Ive (Chief Design Officer, Apple)
